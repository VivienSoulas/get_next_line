We had two bags of grass,
seventy-five pellets of mescaline
five sheets of high powered blotter acid
a salt shaker half full of cocaine
and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers
downers, screamers, laughers...
and also a quart of tequila
a quart of rum
a case of Budweiser
a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.
Not that we needed all that for the trip
but once you get locked into a serious drug collection
the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
